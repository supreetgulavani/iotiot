-Linear Algebra is a field that is a prerequisite to machine learning.
-'Mathematics of data'; Matrices and vectors are the 'language of data'.

=>Expected Value and Mean
  - The average value of a random variable X is 'expected value'(E). >>E(X)
  - Calculated as the probability weighted sum of values that can be drawn
               E(X) = ∑x1*p1,x2*p2,x3*p3,...,xn*pn
  - Mean is denoted as μ, calculated from sample observations, rather than all possible values
                μ = 1/n * ∑x1,x2,x3,...,xn
                μ = P(x)* ∑x
            where x = vaector of observations; P(x) = calculated probability for each value
  - If calculated for a specific variable, mean is denoted as x-bar
      
 # vector mean
from numpy import array
from numpy import mean
# define vector
v = array([1,2,3,4,5,6])
print(v)
# calculate mean
result = mean(v)
print(result)        

-Mean function can calculate the row and column means of matrix by specifying the axis argument and value 0 or 1 
# matrix_means
from numpy import array
from numpy import mean
# define matrix
M = array([
[1,2,3,4,5,6],
[1,2,3,4,5,6]])
print(M)
# column_means
col_mean = mean(M, axis=0)
print(col_mean)
# row_means
row_mean = mean(M, axis=1)
print(row_mean)

=> Variance and Standard Deviation
    - Random variable X is a measure of how much values in the distribution vary on average with respect to the mean.
              Var[X]
    - Variance is calculated as the average squared dierence of each value in the distribution from the expected value
