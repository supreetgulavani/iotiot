- A tensor is the generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions
- When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object you manipulate and pass around is the 'tf.Tensor'.
- A 'tf.Tensor' object represents a partially defined computation that will eventually produce a value.
- Build a graph and run its parts to achieve the desired output.
- A tensor has : A datatype, shape.
- All elements have same datatype

** Rank : number of dimensions
- Get rank: get_rank = tf.rank(my_code)

** Shape : number of elements in each direction
- Get shape: get_shape = tf.shape(my_code)

# Variables

- Create variable: crt_variable = tf.get_variable("crt_variable",[3,4,5])
** Collection :  named lists of tensors
 two collections: 
 1. tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES 
 2. tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES 
If you don't want it to be trainable, store it to tf.GraphKeys.LOCAL_VARIABLES
